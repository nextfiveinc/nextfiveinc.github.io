## Why You'll Love Courage Compass

*   **Turn Fear into a Game**
    Get challenge prompts based on difficulty and category. The app tracks your attempts, rejections, and acceptances, and rewards your courage with milestone badges.

*   **Reflect and Grow**
    After each attempt, the app provides guided questions to help you reflect on the experience. This turns a simple "ask" into a powerful learning opportunity.

*   **Visualize Your Progress**
    An elegant dashboard with charts and a word cloud shows you how far you've come. Seeing your progress visually is a huge motivator to keep going.

*   **Completely Private and Safe**
    The nature of this exercise is personal. Courage Compass works entirely within your browser. Your logs and reflections are for your eyes only and are never sent to a server.

## How It Works

1.  **Get a Prompt** from the challenge generator.
2.  **Take Action** in the real world.
3.  **Log Your Experience** and reflections in your private journal.
