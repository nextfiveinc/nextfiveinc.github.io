## Why You'll Love Web Highlighter

*   **Capture Ideas Instantly**
    Just select text, and it's ready to be saved. No more manually copying and pasting into a separate notes app.

*   **Add Context with Notes**
    Add your own comments to each highlight. It's perfect for jotting down why a particular quote is important or how you plan to use it.

*   **All Your Highlights in One Place**
    See everything you've saved in a clean, simple interface, organized by date and source. Your research is always just a click away.

*   **Flows into Your Workflow**
    With one-click Markdown export, all your highlights and notes are ready to be dropped into your favorite note-taking apps like **Obsidian, Logseq, Notion, Joplin, or Roam Research**.

*   **Completely Private and Free**
    Web Highlighter works entirely within your browser. There are no accounts, no sign-ups, and your data is never sent to a third-party server. It's your data, period.

## How It Works

1.  **Highlight** any text on a page.
2.  **Save** it with an optional note.
3.  **Export** your collection to Markdown whenever you're ready!
