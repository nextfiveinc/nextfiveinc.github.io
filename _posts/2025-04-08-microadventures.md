## Why You'll Love the Micro-Adventure Tracker

*   **Endless Inspiration**
    Feeling uninspired? The suggestion engine provides a random adventure idea with one click. You can also browse the entire library and filter by themes like "Nature" or "Urban Exploration."

*   **Connect Fun to Your Goals**
    This app's magic is connecting adventures to your real-life goals (like Health, Writing, or Networking). The progress view shows how your fun outings are helping you move forward.

*   **Build Your Adventure Log**
    Keep track of everything you want to do and everything you've accomplished. Seeing your "Completed" list grow is a fantastic way to appreciate the richness of your experiences.

*   **Completely Private and Free**
    The tracker works entirely within your browser. There are no accounts, no sign-ups, and your lists of planned and completed adventures are never sent to a server.

## How It Works

1.  **Get a Suggestion** or browse the list for an idea.
2.  **Plan or Complete** it to add it to your personal lists.
3.  **Watch Your Progress** grow as you check off more adventures!
