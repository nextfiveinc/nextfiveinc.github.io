## Why You'll Love the BreakBox

*   **Action Over Indecision**
    The app's most important feature is the one-hour cooldown timer. It's designed to make you act on the suggestion you get, rather than endlessly searching for the "perfect" one.

*   **Make It Your Own**
    Use the input box to add your own quick tasks to the rotation. Over time, the app becomes a personalized generator of your favorite breaks and activities.

*   **A Tool, Not a Distraction**
    This app does one thing and does it well. There are no feeds, no notifications, and no complex features. It's a minimalist tool designed to get you away from your screen, not keep you on it.

*   **Completely Private and Free**
    The BreakBox works entirely within your browser. Your custom tasks and timer state are stored locally and are never sent to a server.

## How It Works

1.  **Click** for a surprise task when you feel stuck.
2.  **Do the Task!** The suggestions are simple and actionable.
3.  **The Timer** starts, encouraging you to enjoy your break before coming back for another prompt.
