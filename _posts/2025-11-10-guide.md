Far too often, we only have a hazy idea of our goals and an even hazier idea of what to do next.

Sometimes, we get far too excited about it and gather a list of 79 items on our ToDo list _(Myself?  Guilty!)_. Only to realise a third of them are completely unrelated to our actual goals.

And that long list just makes us anxious. So, we start avoiding it, till we finally forget all about it all. To go back to square one.

<hr/>
Stop drowning in endless to-do lists.

Guide builds real momentum by forcing a powerful constraint: a maximum of three tasks per day, all linked to your primary goal. Everything else goes into the 'Task Bowl' - out of sight and out of mind, preventing the overwhelm of a never-ending list. No guilt tripping. Keeping your daily view clean and focused.

You might see it as just a glorified (or _simplified_) to-do app. And in a way, it is. But it is also So. Much. More!

Guide is a system that combines your goals with mental 'playbooks' to help you conquer the stress, blocks, and boredom that truly derail progress.
I have been using it personally for a while now and loving it! Give it a try - may be it helps you too.

## Why you'll love Guide

*   **End the overwhelm**
    Guide forces a powerful focus by limiting you to _**3 daily tasks**_ linked to _**1 primary goal**_. Everything else is tucked away in your 'Task Bowl' - out of sight and out of mind, giving you the clarity to actually build momentum.

*   **Your personal mindset coach**
    Productivity isn't just about managing tasks; it's about managing your mind. When you're blocked, stressed, or just plain bored, Guide offers interactive 'playbooks' with actionable advice to get you unstuck. You can even customize them with what works for you.

*   **Build effortless habits**
    Stop wasting mental energy figuring out what's next. With Routines, you can load pre-set task lists for recurring activities (like your "Morning Kickstart" or "Weekly Review") with a single click, making consistency the path of least resistance.

*   **Completely private**
    There are no accounts, no servers, and no clouds. Guide is a single HTML file that runs entirely in your browser. This means your data is 100% yours, it works perfectly offline.

## How it works

1.  **Set your focus**:  Define your larger goals and choose one to concentrate on for a set period (like a week or a month).

2. **Add tasks for your goal**: You can add as many tasks as possible We suggest keeping tasks at a level that you can complete in about 1 hour. You can also click the "Guide me" button to auto-generate the tasks for the goal.

3.  **Add your 3 daily tasks**:  Pick up to 3 small, actionable tasks from your primary goal for the day. You can also get suggestion on where to start by clicing "What should I focus on" button.

3.  **Execute and build momentum**:  Enjoy the clarity of a short list. As you complete tasks, you'll experience the powerful feeling that "done begets done." Leave the list empty once you are done. Resist the add to keep adding more. Enjoy the clean-plate feeling. In the long run, consistency helps; we are looking at 90 complete tasks over a month!

4.  **Consult your playbooks when stuck**:  Feeling overwhelmed or unmotivated? Use the built-in, customizable guides to navigate the mental hurdles and get right back on track.

On the 1st run, **Guide offers a streamlined, 2-step process to import demo data**. This allows new users to explore the features with pre-filled content immediately, rather than facing a blank screen.
 Strongly suggest you give it a go - takes less than 5 mins.
